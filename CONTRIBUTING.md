## After Receiving Your Boards

1. Inspect for any obvious defects (scratches, missing silkscreen)
2. Solder components in this order:
   - Decoupling capacitors (C1, C2) first — smallest
   - Resistors (R1–R7)
   - Pin headers (H1, H2) for XIAO
   - LEDs — check polarity! Long leg (+) goes in square pad
   - Buzzer — check polarity marking on PCB
   - Buttons and slide switch
   - Battery holder last
3. Insert XIAO RP2040 into headers
4. Power on and test with `firmware/micropython/main.py`
